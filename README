Usage:

- import the JAR file of the application
- Create class that extends ClassContentProvider
- Prepare your model
-- Annotate the classes with both @Table and @Authority
-- Annotate the fields with @Column and the primarykey fields with @PrimaryKey. If the field is integer and primarykey you can add @Autoincrement.
- in constructor invoke provideClass for every type of resource you want to expose with the provider.

And it should be done! :)
